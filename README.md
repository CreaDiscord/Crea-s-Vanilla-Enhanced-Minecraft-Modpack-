# 📜 Crea’s Vanilla Enhanced
 
A lightweight **Fabric** modpack that keeps Minecraft feeling **vanilla**—just **smoother performance**, **better visuals** and a few more **convenient features**.  

**No new blocks**, **items**, or **world generation**—just small tweaks and quality-of-life improvements to make the game nicer.

<details>
<summary>💬 Why I Made This Pack
</summary>

A lot of modpacks I see either have too much **bloat**, change the **world generation**, have **missing features**, or just **too many features**.  

I made this pack for good **performance**, a game that **sounds and looks beautiful**, has **Vanilla World Generation**, and the **features I enjoy** ready to go.    

_I wouldn't normally share modpacks but after the change in update pace I thought I should start sharing to hopefully save some of you the stress of modding the game._
