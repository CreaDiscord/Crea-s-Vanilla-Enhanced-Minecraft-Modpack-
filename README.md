# 📜 Crea’s Vanilla Enhanced
 
A lightweight **Fabric** modpack that keeps Minecraft feeling **vanilla**—just smoother and more convenient.  

No new blocks, items, or world generation—just small tweaks and quality-of-life improvements to make the game nicer.

## 💬 Why I Made This Pack

A lot of modpacks I see online either have too much **bloat**, **missing features**, or just **too many features**.  

I made this pack for good **performance**, a game that **sounds and looks beautiful**, and the **features I enjoy** are ready to go.    

_I wouldn't normally share modpacks but after the change in update pace I thought I should start sharing to hopefully save some of you the stress of modding the game._

## ✨ Some Features

### Performance & visuals:

- ⚡ **Sodium** & **Lithium** are the core of the pack's performance
- ⚙️ **Sodium Extras** & **Reece's Sodium Options** let you fine-tune your settings
- 🌈 **Iris Shaders** adds shader support for enhanced graphics
- 🎉 **Visuality** & **Particular ✨**  for the smaller details

### Gameplay improvements:  

- 🪓 **Tree Harvester** lets you chop whole trees at once
- 🛠️ **Visual Workbench** & **Easy Anvils**/**Magic** lets you leave your tools on workbenches
- ⚰️ **Universal Graves** keeps your items safe when you die  

### Inventory & navigation:

- 🎒 **InvMove**, **MouseTweaks** & **Blur+** make your inventory feel cleaner
- 🧰 **Inventory Management** helps organise your chests and inventory
- 🗺️ **Xaero's Minimap**/**World Map** gives you a map and waypoints for easier navigation  

### Fun & convenience:

- 🔊 **Sounds** makes your items pop to life
- 🐦 **AmbientSounds** & **Presence Footsteps** bring immersive sounds to add life to the world 
- 💾 **Cherished Worlds** to back up your worlds so you never lose progress  

**And many more...**    

## 🛠️ Game Versions
- 1.21.10

## 📝 Versioning

The modpack uses a **v1.2.3** numbering system:

1. **Major version** – Minecraft version update (e.g., 1.21 → 1.22)  
2. **Minor version** – Minecraft minor update (e.g., 1.21.9 → 1.21.10)  
3. **Patch version** – Modpack changes, new mods, or tweaks

## 💡 Future Plans
- Try keep Mods consistent through updates.
- Find a stable version without downgrading. _Like how 1.21.1 is the favourite to mod right now._
- Add more fun visuals, qol and performance mods.

## 💬 Notes
- **Fabric** modpack only
- I don't include a shader pack
- Updates happen mainly when Minecraft updates or I add new mods. Broken mods may be temporarily disabled
- I’ll keep it updated to whatever version I’m currently playing — right now that’s **Minecraft 1.21.10**
- If you've read this far... Why not leave a **Like**?
