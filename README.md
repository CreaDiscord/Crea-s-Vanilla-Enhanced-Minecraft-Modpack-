# 📜 Crea’s Vanilla Enhanced
 
A lightweight **Fabric** modpack that keeps Minecraft feeling **vanilla**—just smoother and more convenient.  

No new blocks, items, or world generation—just small tweaks and quality-of-life improvements to make the game nicer.

## 💬 Why I Made This Pack

A lot of modpacks I see online either have too much **bloat**, **missing features**, or just **too many features**.  

I made this pack for good **performance**, a game that **sounds and looks beautiful**, and the **features I enjoy** are ready to go.    

_I wouldn't normally share modpacks but after the change in update pace I thought I should start sharing to hopefully save some of you the stress of modding the game._

## ✨ Some Features

### Visual additions:

- 🌈 **Iris Shaders** adds shader support for enhanced graphics
- 🎉 **Visuality** & **Particular ✨**  for the smaller details
- 💣 **Explosive Enhancement** gives explosions an extra visual kick

### Gameplay additions:

- 🛠️ **Visual Workbench** & **Easy Anvils**/**Magic** lets you leave your tools on workbenches
- ⚰️ **Universal Graves** keeps your items safe when you die 
- 🗺️ **Xaero's Minimap**/**World Map** for easier navigation  

### Inventory & Management additions:

- 🎒 **InvMove** & **MouseTweaks** make your inventory nicer to use
- 🧰 **Inventory Management** helps organise your chests and inventory
- 🔬 **Smooth Gui** & **Blur+** to make menus pop 
- 💾 **Cherished Worlds** to back-up your worlds so you never lose progress
